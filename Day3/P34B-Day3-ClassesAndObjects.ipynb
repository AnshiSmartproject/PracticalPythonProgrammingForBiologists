Classes provide a way to organize and structure code, allowing you to define custom objects with their own properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Fundementally, it means you are setting parameters for how your data should look, and what methods and functions it should have.\n","\n","Lets say we are defining a class named House. Well I'd expect it to have things like \"Number of doors\", \"Number of Windows\", \"Address\", \"People who live there\".....\n","\n","We could store the data in dictionaries or lists, but by building a class I am then able to use something like ```new_house(2, 8, \"123 new street\", ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo'])``` and then access the data easily and reliably. \n","\n","It also can contain specialised functions that relate directly to that class, for example \n","```\n","new_house.distance_to(\"Liverpool\")\n","``` \n","could be made to use the internal data, the new variables, and it's all stored away inside the class. In reality they work much like string manipulation methods but we define them ourselves.\n"," \n","It is particularly useful in bioinformatics and biology as it allows you to model real-world entities and their interactions, and especially when working with less common types of data.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uC38cUMaCOM3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Classes are important because they contain all of those methods and functions available to ***every*** sequence object that is created.
