The code itself should be equally comfortable on a local computer or a Jupyter notebook, and most of these steps are for the computer environment.\n","\n","- Create the Python script: Write your Python code in a file with a .py extension - it is not technically essential but good practice.\n","\n","- Define the shebang line: The first line of your script must include a shebang line to specify that it is Python and which interpreter to be used. This ensures that the correct Python version is invoked when running the script. For example:\n","```\n","#!/usr/bin/python or #!/usr/bin/env python3.\n","```\n","This could vary depending on your computer\n","\n","- Add executable permissions (Mac/Linux only, perhaps?): If you are working on a Unix/Linux system (macs are a unix system), you need to make your Python script executable by assigning the appropriate permissions. Use the chmod command to set the executable permission: ```chmod +x script.py```\n","\n","- Run the script: On the terminal move to the directory where your Python script is located, and run the script using ```./script.py```. If you have set up the shebang line correctly it shouldn't need you to specify python, but you can optionally do that if required: ```python script.py```"],"metadata":{"id":"vBv7em0QoUJe"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Exercise - Run your code\n","\n","Lets take the code that you developed for the Day1-Project and turn it into a command line program.
