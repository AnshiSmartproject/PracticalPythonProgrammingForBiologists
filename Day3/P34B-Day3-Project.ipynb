However as we have seen today there are many (many!) ways to approach any dataset. Within your group work together to consider a question that you want to test from this data. \n","\n","You have been provided with two files:\n","- ```Day3-Project-nextclade_metadata``` - Data & Metadata of 126 reference covid19 strains and the Spike (S) protein modificiation data\n","- ```Day3-Project-nextclade.fasta``` - Reference fasta sequence file for the corresponding spike protein\n","\n","This could be, for example:\n","- Test the sequence composition compared between strains from the fasta\n","- Calculate variation in sequence substitutions in the metadata\n","- Output a phylogenetic tree of strains (I think a subset as it may be too computaionally intensive for google Colab, however you could use your own PCs)\n","\n","Essential steps:\n","1. Filter the metadata file to remove bad and missing data (pandas!)\n","2. Read in the fasta sequence file using biopython. Only include sequences that have passed your step one filter!\n","3. Create a class object for strains (see below)\n","4. Now perform some analysis!\n","\n","It is good practice to create a class object. Some suggestions to contain:\n","- The spike protein sequence and key variables\n","- Methods to calculate key statistics (GC%, length)\n","- A method to calculate the number/size of gap regions (strings of Ns in the sequences) - does this correspond with the quality assesment?\n","\n","This project is largely undefined and the intention is to give you a real-life look at approaching a dataset for the first time. Think about your objectives before jumping in! Good luck!\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jFBkgBQlauop"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"BT2qGy1GgRHB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
