However as we have seen today there are many (many!) ways to approach any dataset. Within your group work together to consider a question that you want to test from this data. \n","\n","This could be, for example:\n","- Test the sequence composition compared between strains from the fasta\n","- Calculate variation in sequence substitutions in the metadata\n","- Output a phylogenetic tree of strains (I think a subset as it may be too computaionally intensive for google Colab, however you could use your own PCs)\n","\n","Essential steps:\n","1. Filter the metadata file to remove bad and missing data (pandas!)\n","2. Read in the fasta sequence file using biopython. Only include sequences that have passed your step one filter!\n","3. Now perform some analysis!\n","\n","Good luck!\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jFBkgBQlauop"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"BT2qGy1GgRHB"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
