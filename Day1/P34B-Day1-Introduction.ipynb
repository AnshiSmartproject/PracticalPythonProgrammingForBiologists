    "\n",
    "> Python coding notebooks are interactive documents that allow for the creation and sharing of code, text, and visualizations. **You're in one right now!** The ```.ipynb``` format was created by the Jupyter project and is widely used to create notebooks that can be shared, edited, and executed by others, without requiring the installation of any software on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```.ipynb``` notebooks consist of a series of cells, each of which can contain either code, text, or graphics. Code cells contain Python code that can be executed directly within the notebook. Text cells can contain formatted text, images, and links, and graphics cells display visualizations such as plots, charts, and maps.\n"
