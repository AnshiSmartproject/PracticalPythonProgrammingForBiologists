In the olden days of a few years ago we would use the `close()` method in python, but now it is recommended to use the ```with``` manager for more simple and readable code. I'm mostly including this here in case you see or use older code that uses the previous format.\n","\n","Basically, because you're interacting with files outside of python it needs to be told when you're finished, for a few reasons:\n","\n","1. Memory management: When a file is opened in Python, the operating system allocates memory to store the data read/written from/to a file. If the file is not closed properly, the memory used by the file remains allocated which can cause performance issues or crash the program.\n","\n","2. Data corruption: If a file is not closed properly, any data that has not been written to the file may be lost (think of a USB unplugged too soon). This can result in corrupted or incomplete data, which can cause issues when the data is later read or used.\n","\n","3. Resource management: When a file is opened, it is locked by the operating system to prevent other processes from modifying it. If a file is not closed properly, it remains locked, preventing other processes from accessing or modifying the file. This can cause issues if the file is needed by another program or process.\n","\n","To summarise, always close the file!
