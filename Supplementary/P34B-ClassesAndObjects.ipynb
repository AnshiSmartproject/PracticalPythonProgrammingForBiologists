Classes provide a way to organize and structure code, allowing you to define custom objects with their own properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Fundementally, it means you are setting parameters for how your data should look, and what methods and functions it should have.\n","\n","Lets say we are defining a class named House. Well I'd expect it to have things like \"Number of doors\", \"Number of Windows\", \"Address\", \"People who live there\".....\n","\n","We could store the data in dictionaries or lists, but by building a class I am then able to use something like ```new_house(2, 8, \"123 new street\", ['John', 'Paul', 'George', 'Ringo'])``` and then access the data easily and reliably. \n","\n","It also can contain specialised functions that relate directly to that class, for example ```new_house.distance_to(\"Liverpool\")``` could be made to use the internal data, the new variables, and it's all stored away inside the class. In reality they work much like string manipulation methods but we define them ourselves.\n"," \n","It is particularly useful in bioinformatics and biology as it allows you to model real-world entities and their interactions, and especially when working with less common types of data.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ndcLTqVPDwYo"},"source":["#### The two types of class 'methods'\n","\n","Classes are important because they contain all of those methods and functions available to ***every*** sequence object that is created.

You'll often see dunder methods like ```__len__``` or ```__str__``` to calculate length or return a string.\n","\n","The most important constructor is the ```__init__``` method though, called the constructor, as this defines the class and is called whenever an object is created.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GlEkP0grM0ng"},"source":["## Creating our own classes\n","\n","All good and complex, but lets actually create our own class to better understand what we are looking at.\n","\n","Note that convention has classes named with Capital Letters and no underscores.
