Biologist data even more so. Here we have some data on bacterial abundance as collected by some well meaning scientists but unfortunately it's a bit of a mess. It is technically in a four column format liks this, howver when you look below it's mixed up:\n","\n","```\n","| Collector | Percentage abundance | Dominant Phyla | Date |\n","```\n","\n","Delimeters:\n","- Between collected data samples: ```,```\n","- Between data fields per sample: ```-```\n","\n","We want to clean up the data and make some sense out of it. **The objective is to output a count of samples dominated by each phyla.**\n","\n","1. Look at the text file first so that you know what we are looking at!\n","2. Read in the file ```MessyData.txt``` with ```open()``` as one object (it is too mixed-up to read line-by-line), and then split based on the delimiters above\n","\n","If you want to challange yourself try to clean the data first before looking in this guide section!\n","I recommend using ```print()``` functions after each step to check the output is as expected.\n","\n","---\n","\n","<details>\n","<summary>Step-by-step guide</summary>\n","\n","2. First split the data by commas into a list of ```records```\n","2. Within a new loop, split each record by ```-``` into the 4 data elements\n","3. Within a new **nested** loop, clean the whitepace off each element (create a temporary ```new_record``` inside the loop to keep experiments together)\n","4. Create a list of all the dominant phyla per sample - some samples have multiple, so have to be split again first! Careful here, because you want a basic list, not a list of lists\n","\n","</details>\n","\n","---\n","\n","5. Finally, end with a clean list of all named phyla in a list named ```phyla_count```. There may be more than one phyla per sample.
