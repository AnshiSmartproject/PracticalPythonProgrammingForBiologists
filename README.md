## Overview 
This is a four-day course designed to provide an introduction to the Python programming language for all biologists and life scientists. Throughout the course, participants will learn python programming concepts and practical applications, engaging in hands-on coding exercises and projects to solidify their understanding. 
The course is intended for biologists at all levels (students, researchers, and group leaders) with little or no prior programming experience. The pace of the course will begin foundational and develop into more complex aspects, with lots of time dedicated to the practice of the concepts covered.

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:
- Write and run basic Python code for all reasons including to extract, parse, process, analyse and visualise biological data
- Use specialised bioinformatics libraries in your Python code
- Understand and perform data analysis and statistics using Python
